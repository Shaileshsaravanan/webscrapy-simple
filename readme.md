# Simple Web Scraper

This is a simple Python web scraper that extracts quotes and their authors from a given website. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scraper, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `web_scraper.py` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `web_scraper.py` file is located.

3. Replace the `target_url` variable in `web_scraper.py` with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

4. Run the scraper:

```bash
python web_scraper.py
```

The scraper will make an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, parse the HTML content, and print the extracted quotes and their authors.

## Example

For demonstration purposes, we will scrape quotes from a hypothetical website called "Example Quotes Website."

```python
# Replace this URL with the one you want to scrape
target_url = "https://example-quotes-website.com"
```

The `web_scraper.py` script will fetch quotes and authors from the given URL and display them in the terminal.
